# Enhanced CSM Dashboards (Drive‑First, AI‑Ready)

## How to use
1) Replace the placeholder Google Drive links inside each `Dashboard_*.html` (top chips + iframe embeds).
   - Use **Drive "preview" URLs** for iframes (PDF/Slides).
2) Open the HTML file locally or host it on any static site (e.g., GitHub Pages).
3) Use the **AI Shortcuts** section: copy prompts to Gemini/ChatGPT with the account’s Resources folder attached.
4) Update the inline `CONFIG` object to refresh CSS history, vCores, API counts, and timeline.
